 workerinstaller
=================

automates the installation of 2+ workers in a lab-bc cluster.  super useful if
you don't want to manually copy stuff all over the place.

NOTE: be sure to edit the values in install.sh before running it!  i did my
best to make that script idempotent and somewhat neat but it wasn't exactly
something i spent more than two hours on, so better have no errors the first
time you run it then need to rerun everything and risk clobbering something i
didn't foresee.
